# DESIGN DOCUMENT 05: THE SOCIAL META-GAME & PROGRESSION

**Scope:** Social Contracts, The Phases of Organization, The "Cancer" Penalties, and The End Game (Terraforming).
**Core Thesis:** "A solitary cell survives the day; a tissue survives the epoch."

## 1.0 THE PROTOCOL (THE DIGITAL CONSTITUTION)

We do not use "Guilds" or "Clans." We use **Protocols**. A Protocol is a programmable smart contract that governs a specific tethered group.

### 1.1 The Handshake
When two vehicles tether, they must agree to a Protocol.
* **The Default:** "Loose Coupling." No resource sharing. Just physics dragging.
* **The Upgrade:** "Symplast Coupling." Requires mutual assent.
    * *Effect:* Opens the valves. Fuel and Water tanks auto-balance across the link.

### 1.2 The Constitution Slider
The "Nucleus" player (Convoy Leader) sets the parameters of the Protocol.
* **Tax Rate:** What % of harvested resources goes to the "Common Stock" vs. the "Private Tank"?
* **Energy Priority:** Who gets power when the grid browns out? (e.g., *Priority: Life Support* vs. *Priority: Engines*).
* **The Friction:** High taxes create a rich stockpile but annoy independent players. Low taxes attract players but leave the convoy vulnerable in emergencies.

### 1.3 The "Nucleus" Role
* **The Mechanic:** In a large Convoy (5+ vehicles), one player acts as the **Nucleus**.
* **The Restriction:** While in Nucleus Mode, this player **cannot drive**. They are staring at screens.
* **The Power:**
    * *Route Planning:* They set the GPS waypoints for the drivers.
    * *Retrograde Signaling:* They can "Force" a disconnect of a specific tether (amputating a limb/player).
* **The Mutiny:** If the Nucleus makes bad calls, the drivers can vote to **"Depose"** (revoke admin rights) or simply **"Lyse"** (physically detach and leave).

## 2.0 THE PHASES OF ORGANIZATION (PROGRESSION)

Progression is not leveling up a character stats. It is **Structural Metamorphosis**. The game shifts genres as you grow.

### 2.1 Phase 1: The Nomad (Survival Horror)
* **Unit:** Single Vehicle.
* **Gameplay:** Scavenging, running from storms, hiding. High mortality.
* **The Filter:** The "Phage" swarms eat small grids.
* **Goal:** Find a partner. Survive long enough to Tether.

### 2.2 Phase 2: The Convoy (Co-op Vehicle Sim)
* **Unit:** 2–5 Tethered Vehicles.
* **Gameplay:** Logistics and Travel.
    * *Specialization:* Player A becomes the Engine; Player B becomes the Refinery.
    * *The Slipstream:* Efficient travel allows access to deeper, more dangerous biomes.
* **Goal:** Accumulate enough mass and resources to build a **Foundry Module**.

### 2.3 Phase 3: The Arcology (City Builder / Tower Defense)
* **Unit:** 10+ Vehicles + Sessile Structures.
* **Gameplay:** The Convoy finds a "Safe Harbor" (e.g., a valley or ruined stadium) and initiates **The Rooting**.
    * *Metamorphosis:* Large vehicles deploy permanent anchors. They lose the ability to move. They become **Districts**.
    * *The Membrane:* The group builds a static "Dome" or "Windbreak" around the settlement.
* **Goal:** **Terraforming.** Stabilize the local weather.

## 3.0 THE END GAME: TERRAFORMING (HOMEOSTASIS)

The game is not about escaping Earth; it is about **Fixing It**.

### 3.1 The Climate Engine
* **The Problem:** The local biome is a "Wet Zone" (Stalled Storm).
* **The Solution:** The Arcology builds a **Climate Stabilizer** (e.g., a massive CO2 Scrubber or Cloud Seeder).
* **The Cost:** It requires insane amounts of power (The Nucleus) and constant maintenance (The Workers).
* **The Effect:**
    * Over weeks of gameplay, the storm above the Arcology begins to break.
    * *Visuals:* Sunlight hits the mud.
    * *Physics:* The mud dries into soil.
    * *Ecology:* The "Weed Trees" die back; "Crop" efficiency increases by 500%.

### 3.2 The Garden
* Once the weather is stabilized, the "Livestock" and "Farm" modules function at 100%.
* The Arcology becomes a **Source**. It exports food/fuel to struggling Nomads.
* **The Win State:** You are not just surviving; you are the *reason* others survive. You have become a Mitochondrion for the world.

## 4.0 SOCIAL FRICTION: THE "CANCER" MECHANIC

How do we discourage griefing and hoarding without banning players? We use **Physics**.

### 4.1 The Center of Mass Penalty
* **The Hoard:** If a player keeps all resources in their private storage (refusing to pay "Taxes" to the Protocol), their vehicle gets heavier.
* **The Drag:** In a tethered convoy, a heavy, off-center vehicle acts as a literal anchor.
    * *Steering:* The Convoy pulls to the left constantly.
    * *Speed:* The whole group slows down.
* **The Signal:** The Nucleus UI highlights the "Parasitic Drag" in Red.
* **The Cure:** Peer Pressure. "Hey Atlas, dump your cargo into the shared grid or we cut you loose."
* **The Lesson:** Greed is physically cumbersome.

### 4.2 The "Dead Man's Switch" (Right of Exit)
* **The Fear:** Being trapped in a toxic group or a "Cult."
* **The Mechanic:** Every cockpit has a mechanical **"Emergency Sever"** lever.
* **The Effect:**
    * Instantly cuts all tethers.
    * Ejects the player from the Protocol (and the shared power grid).
    * *Risk:* You are now alone in the storm. You might lose power instantly.
    * *Reward:* Autonomy.
* **Why:** This guarantees that every member of a Convoy *wants* to be there. A society that retains members only by force is doomed to fail (see: Cancer).

## 5.0 THE NEW PLAYER EXPERIENCE: THE "SYMBIONT"

How do new players join a mature server with massive Cities? They play as the **Microbiome**.

### 5.1 The Drifter Class
* **Vehicle:** A tiny, high-speed Skiff or Drone. Cheap to build.
* **Role:** **The Courier / The Janitor.**
    * Large Cities generate "Waste" and have "Small Leaks" they cannot reach.
    * The Drifter can dock in small vents. They scrub the hull. They run small errands between Cities.
* **The Gig Economy:**
    * The City posts "Contracts" (Fetch quests).
    * The Drifter accepts.
    * *Reward:* The City grants the Drifter "Docking Rights" (Safety during storms) and refined fuel.
* **Progression:** Eventually, the Drifter earns enough Prestige to build a full Crawler and join the Convoy as a full member (Organelle).

### DESIGNER'S NOTE ON "THE LESSON"
The progression curve is designed to mirror biological evolution:
1.  **Prokaryote (Solo):** Life is nasty, brutish, and short.
2.  **Eukaryote (Tethered):** Life is complex, but safer.
3.  **Multicellular (City):** Life is stable, but requires sacrifice (Rooting).

The player *feels* the relief of the transition phases. The moment they first tether to a partner and see their fuel consumption drop by 50% is the moment the game teaches them that **Altruism is Optimization.**
