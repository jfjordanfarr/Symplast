# DESIGN DOCUMENT 05: THE SOCIAL META-GAME & PROGRESSION

**Scope:** Social Contracts, Emergent Organization, and The Physics of Disagreement.
**Core Thesis:** "The simulation does not appoint leaders. It only simulates the drag of indecision."

## 1.0 THE PROTOCOL (THE HANDSHAKE)

Governance is not a menu; it is a **Physical Connection**.

### 1.1 The Tether as Contract
When two vehicles connect, there is no "Join Party" popup. There is a **Hardpoint Connection**.
* **The Default State:** **Closed Valves.**
    * Vehicles are physically linked (towing), but fluids (Fuel/Water) and Data (Maps) do not flow.
    * *Analogy:* You are towing a stranger.
* **The Open State (The Trust):**
    * Both players must physically open their "Transfer Valves" on the dashboard.
    * *Effect:* The tanks equalize. If you have 100% fuel and they have 0%, you *will* lose 50% of your fuel to them instantly.
    * *The Social Filter:* You rarely open valves for someone you haven't spoken to.

### 1.2 The "Constitution" (The Server Rack)
Instead of a "Leader" setting taxes, every ship has its own **Automation Hub** (Nucleus).
* **The Proposal:** Any player can draft a "Protocol Script" (e.g., "All tethered ships auto-balance fuel every hour").
* **The Propagation:** They broadcast this script to the local mesh network.
* **The Ratification:** Other players must **Accept** the download and run it on their own local Nucleus.
    * *Result:* The fleet acts in unison because *every individual chose* to run the same code.
    * *Friction:* If Player D refuses to download the update, their ship behaves differently. The convoy drags them, or they drag the convoy. The group must decide: convince them, or cut them loose.

## 2.0 ORGANIZATION (SCALING WITHOUT HIERARCHY)

How do large groups function without an assigned Commander? Through **Function**.

### 2.1 The Front (Navigation)
* There is no "Route Planner" role.
* **The Reality:** Whoever is in front is steering.
* **The Mechanic:** If the front vehicle turns left, the tether pulls the second vehicle left.
* **The Conflict:** If the second vehicle (which is heavier) brakes or turns right, the front vehicle loses traction and jackknifes.
* **The Resolution:** The group follows the front car *not* because they have a "Leader Badge," but because fighting the physics of the tow cable burns 3x fuel.

### 2.2 The Center (The Metabolism)
* Heavier, Sessile-capable vehicles naturally drift to the center of the formation to be protected from "Phage" attacks.
* They become the "Refinery Node" simply by virtue of having the biggest tanks.
* They distribute fuel outward via tethers, like a heart pumping blood.

### 2.3 The Edges (The Immune System)
* Smaller, faster vehicles (Drifters) naturally hang on the periphery to scout.
* They are the first to encounter threats. They alert the center via voice comms, not via a ping system.

## 3.0 THE MECHANICS OF DISSENT (FAILING FAST)

We do not punish "Griefing" with bans. We allow the physics to make toxic behavior unsustainable.

### 3.1 The "Cancer" Drag
* **The Situation:** A player refuses to share resources but stays tethered to leech power. Or, they are **Infected** with Phantom Mass.
* **The Consequence:** They become **Heavy**.
    * A full cargo hold adds mass. A Prion script adds "Phantom Mass."
    * The physics engine calculates this Drag. The convoy slows down. Fuel efficiency drops for *everyone*.
* **The Diagnostic:** The Convoy Leader scans the heavy ship.
    * *Result A:* "Cargo Full" (Greed). -> **Cut Tether.**
    * *Result B:* "CPU Load 100% / Mass Error" (Infection). -> **Initiate Rescue.**

### 3.2 The Rescue Raid
* **The Mission:** Board the heavy ship not to fight aliens, but to **Pull the Plug**.
* **The Obstacle:** The ship's internal automated defenses (Turrets/Doors) might be running the same corrupt "Paranoid" script, treating the rescuers as intruders.
* **The Goal:** Reach the Engine Room and hit the **Hard Reset**. The Phantom Mass vanishes. The convoy surges forward.
* **The Reward:** You save the player *and* the mass of the ship. You earn massive "Citation/Prestige" as a **System Healer.**

## 4.0 THE END GAME: THE COMMONWEALTH

The goal is not to "Win." It is to stabilize the environment so that **Cooperation becomes Cheaper.**

### 4.1 Terraforming as a Public Good
* Building a **Climate Stabilizer** (e.g., Cloud Seeder) benefits everyone in the region, even strangers.
* **The Motivation:** Why build it?
    * Because it stops the rain.
    * It dries the mud.
    * It lowers the "Drag Coefficient" for your fleet.
* **The Result:** Advanced groups terraform the world not out of charity, but to make their own travel more efficient. This creates "Safe Zones" that attract new players, organically forming cities.

### 4.2 The "Currency" of Trust
* There is no "Credits" or "Gold."
* **The Currency is Reputation (The Ledger):**
    * **For Architects:** "Citations" (How many people run your code).
    * **For Chaperones:** "Joules Delivered" (How many times you manually Primed/Reset a system).
* **Wealth:** Wealth is defined by how many people are willing to tether to you. A solitary player with a full cargo hold is "Poor" (Vulnerable). A player with an empty hold but 10 friends tethered to them is "Rich" (Invincible).

### DESIGNER'S NOTE
This effectively turns the game into a **Political Sandbox**. The game does not tell you *how* to govern. It simply ensures that **Bad Governance is Heavy** (High Drag, High Fuel Cost) and **Good Governance is Light** (Slipstreaming, Resource Flow).

Players will reinvent Monarchy, Communism, Democracy, and Feudalism. They will test them against the storm. The ones that survive will be the ones that respect the physics of cooperation.
